## A paper on multi-tissue multi-individual gene expression analysis using tensor networks

A paper very similar to our idea on multi-tissue multi-individual gene expression analysis using tensor networks has already been published: [[Reference notes/Three-way clustering of multi-tissue multi-individual gene expression data using semi-nonnegative tensor decomposition\|Three-way clustering of multi-tissue multi-individual gene expression data using semi-nonnegative tensor decomposition]]

## Tensor networks to find expression patterns in various cells

A recent paper on using tensor networks and finding expression patterns across cell types and individuals. They took data from the pancreas and skin cells and the similarity in expressing certain regulatory genes. [Link](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011616)
