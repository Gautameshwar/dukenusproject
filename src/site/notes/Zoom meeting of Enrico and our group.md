## Notes

### Summary of the data we have access to by Enrico
- all patients are not guaranteed to have the same data structure and may miss a row or column here and there.
- Cell grouping is done through gene clustering (lots of algorithms already available). We see if a certain set of genes are highly expressed and if so, they are labelled as $\alpha, \beta -$cells.

### What Enrico wants our algorithm to do
- Generate graphs and gene networks through correlations (quantum correlation?)
- See if the graphs are similar or different between sick and healthy patients.
- Enrico is interested in using "quantum correlation" in tensors to describe the gene correlations that lead to certain expressions.

### To do 
- Bayesian networks- a probabilistic algorithm to find the gene networks?
- Do a regular SVD, check with the standard literature, and add something "quantum" to the work. It involves a grant that demands something new and more challenging than the conventional numerical techniques.
- People want to buy quantum! Let us give one (a motivation). A hybrid quantum neural network algorithm?
- Read about gene coexpression and how it is represented as a matrix.
